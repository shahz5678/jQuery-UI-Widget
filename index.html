				 <h3>Why don't elephants use umbrellas?</h3>
				 <div>
					The answer is simple, really.  Elephants couldn't hold an umbrella.  I'm sure they wouldn't mind though, if you attached an umbrella to their head.  Not only would it be a spectacle it would help them stay quite cool. 
				 </div>
				 <h3>Cats should like pajamas.</h3>
				 <div>
					Unfortunately, cats don't like pajamas.  They feel humiliated by being dressed up in clothing.  But pajamas are quite wonderful.  
				 </div>
				 <h3>Is their a portal in my closet?</h3>
				 <div>
					I ask myself this question every night when I go to bed.  Some would say, no, there is no portal in your closet.  
				 </div>
				 <h3>If only ghosts had teeth.</h3>
				 <div>
					I often think about the sad way that ghosts live their lives. 
				 </div>
				 <h3>Section 5</h3>
				 <h3>If only peanuts had eyes.</h3>
				 <div>
					If peanuts had eyes they could live such better lives.  Right now, millions of peanuts are sitting around blind an unable to experience vision.
